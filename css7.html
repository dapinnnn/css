                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                when an unknown printer took a gallery of type and scranbled it to make a type
                specimen book. It has survived not only five conturies, but also the leap into 
                electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It wa popularised in
                the 1960s with the release of letraset sheets containing lorem ipsum passages,
                and more recentiy with dekstop publishing software like aldus pagemaker including
                versions of lorem ipsum.

                it is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
                content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using lorem ipsum is
                that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,as opposed to using 
                'Content here, content here', making it look like readable english. Many dekstop
                publishing packages and web page editors now use lorem ipsum as their deafult model
                text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
                Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,sometimes on
                purpose (injected humour and the like).
